## What is Markdown? `## is the command for heading 2`
   - Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
   Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

# How is Markdown different?
  - Markdown is not a WYSIWYG because you don't click buttones (thing Microsoft Word for stylistic changes) and see an 
  immediate result.
  - In **Markdown** we use syntax (the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols mean) to 
  modify the text, appearance and style of the file display to the end user.
  
# What are some basic commands and what do they do?
  
  |  **Command**  |  **Example**  |  **Output**  |
  | ------- | ------- | ------ |
  | `** **` | `**Bold**`  | **Bold** |
  | `* *`    | `*Italics*` | *Italics* |
  | ` [txt](url) `  | `[Click Here](Link URL)` |  [Click Here](https://iamandrewcarroll.github.io/reading-notes/)  |
  <sub>A best practice for **bold** and *italics* is to always use the asterisk!</sub>
  
## Pretty Cool So Far!  But What if I want something more visually engaging?

### Best to add a couple images! `### is the command for heading 3`

### Looking Good!  But how did you do that?!  The markdown image code didn't allow me to resize images!
```
<img src="copy and pase the url of the image directly uploaded to github here" width=xx% height=xx%>
```
  
### But why do we use Markdown?
- Markdown can be used for everything! Websites, documents, notes, you name it!
- Markdown interacts well across most platforms! iOS, Microsoft, etc.
- Can be read by any text editor making it future proof!
  
<sub>Nice list! You can use `- * or +` to make unordered lists!
