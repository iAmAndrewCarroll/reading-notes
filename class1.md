# How is Markdown different?
  - Markdown is not a WYSIWYG because you don't click buttones (thing Microsoft Word for stylistic changes) and see an 
  immediate result.
  - In **Markdown** we use syntax (the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols mean) to 
  modify the text, appearance and style of the file display to the end user.
