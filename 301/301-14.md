## Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  * Marketing and advertising focused almost exclusively towards males; boys specifically.  Computers were marketed as toys or gadgets for boys.  Just look at movies like Weird Science...disgusting, sex definitely sells, and young boys are impressionable.
  * Home computers became a realm of haves and have-nots.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   * By the time they got to the college level they were well-versed in the how, what, and why of computers and their capabilities.

## Diversity Matters
