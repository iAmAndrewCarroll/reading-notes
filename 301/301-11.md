# noSQL vs SQL

| --------- |   SQL    |    NoSQL   |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Language: | SQL   |  Varies  |
| ------ | ACID COMPLIANCE | BASE PHilsophy |
| ------- | Joins Supported | Horizontal Scalability |
| ------- | Transactions Supported | Schema Flexibility |
| ------- | Mature & Established | Big Data & Unstructured Data |

1, SQL: structured, well defined & related
   * Example: Customer data

2. NoSQL: unstructured, dynamic and flexible
   * Example: Social media data with user profiles, posts, comments stored in a JSON

3. NoSQL graph databases

4. NoSQL is best for scalability.

# SQL vs noSQL

1. Structured Query Language

2. A database that organizes data into tables with relationships between them

3. 

4. Definition of the structure, tables, and constraints in a database.

5. NoSQL: a database that allows for flexible, schema-less data storage.

6. NoSQL uses various data models like key-value and document to store and retrieve data.

7. Mongo stores collections of JSON-like documents.

8. Mongo is more flexible allowing for dynamic schemas and easy modification of data structures

9. NoSQL disadvantages...they sacrifice some of their consistency and data integrity in favor of scalability and flexibility.
