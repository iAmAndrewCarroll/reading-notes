# Choosing a Text Editor (As Personal of a Preference as Knee Socks or No Shows)

## An Exercise in Choosing What You Like vs What is "Right"

### What is a **text editor** anyway?
- A **text editor** allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you
write to build a website.
- Very likely one of the most important tools in the web devs arsenal.
- Some editors will even provide closing tags when you open a tag!

### Are there certain features I should look for?
- *Code Completion:* You start typing and this feature displays predictive responses.
Kind of like texting on yoru smartphone.
- *Syntax Highlighting:* Literally highlights text as you type making it easier to spot
upon review.  This really helps with review and error checks.
- *Themes:* Themes allow you to change the color display of the text editor.  This can help
reduce eyestrain and make the work environment feel a bit more comfortable and cozy.
- *Extensions:* Allows you to add functionality and power within the text editor environment
as your skills and condfidence grow!

### Great!  That is really healpful...but don't I already have Notepad or Text Editor?!
The simple answer is...**Of Course!**  On a *Windows* device you will have *Notepad* and on *Mac OS*
you will have *Text Editor*.  **Side Note!** Linux versions have different text editors for 
different releases so you'll have to find that based on your specific release.
- So why not use these text editors?  I'm going to say the quiet part loud...**They are pretty
basic stuff...nothing fancy and often without capabilities and features mentioned above!**
- Can I still use them?  Of course you can, but it is worth checking out other options at
the very least before you commit to the bare bones babies.

| BB Edit | Win & Mac | $49.99|
| Visual Studio Code | Win, Mac & Linux | Free|

## IDE vs Text Editor
### IDE
- IDE is short for Integrated Development Environment
- Includes a text editor, compiler, debugger and file manager all in one
### Text Editor
- Exactly that!

### So What do the following commands even do?
- pwd: full path to the current working directory
- ls: lists information about directories and files in the working directory
- cd: changes the current directory of the terminal
- mkdir: make directory quite literally makes a new directory
- touch: commonly used for file creation this commands primary function is for timestamping

### Expalain What is happening in the following scenarios:
- cd projects: the directory is changed to *projects*
- mkdir new-projects: a new directory is created named *new_project*
- touch new-project/newfile.md: a new file, *newfile.md* is created within *new-project* directory
- cd ..: the current directory is moved two levels up
- ls projects/new-project: returns information on directories and files within *projects/new-projects
