# In Class Random Example Code

<!-- # File Name: random.py
# Import the library random.
import random

# Create a list to get a random number from
number_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Declare a variable and assign it the return of a random value from number_list
random_number = random.choice(number_list)

# Print the random number
print(random_number)

# Is there anything wrong with this code? -->

The above code did run but there is a circular import error.  It was looking locally and trying to import itself (line 3 'random' was also the name of the file random.py)

In this case we are trying to import the library 'random' in order to activate the 'choice' command/function

What's the order?  local, built ins (look up MRO for more information)
