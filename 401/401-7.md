1. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.
   * scope of a name defnes the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on.  A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope.
   * Global Scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code
   * Local Scope: the names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope

2. How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?
   * Global (module) scope: s the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.
   * Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

3. In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.
   * When used properly Big O notation can give us an idea of the computing power required of an algorithm.  Being familiar with this methodology can help us find the most efficient means of running an operation.  Depending on the size and complexity and type of data involved Big O  notation gives us a good idea of what to expect.

4. Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.
   * def probability_of_rolling_number(number):
  """Calculates the probability of rolling a specific number."""
  trials = 10000
  number_of_rolls = 0
  for _ in range(trials):
    result = roll_dice()
    if result == number:
      number_of_rolls += 1
  return number_of_rolls / trials
  
  * This code first imports the random module, which provides a function called randint() that can be used to generate random numbers. The roll_dice() function uses the randint() function to generate a random number between 1 and 6, which represents the result of a dice roll.

  * The probability_of_rolling_number() function calculates the probability of rolling a specific number by simulating a large number of dice rolls. The function first declares a variable called trials and sets it to 10000. This number represents the number of times that the dice will be rolled.

  * The function then declares a variable called number_of_rolls and sets it to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of times that the specific number is rolled.

  * The function then uses a for loop to simulate the dice rolls. The for loop iterates 10000 times, and each time it iterates, it calls the roll_dice() function to generate a random number. If the random number is equal to the specific number, the number_of_rolls variable is incremented by 1.

  * After the for loop has finished iterating, the probability_of_rolling_number() function calculates the probability of rolling the specific number by dividing the number_of_rolls variable by the trials variable.

  * The if __name__ == "__main__": statement at the end of the code ensures that the code will only be executed when the file is run as a script. If the file is imported as a module, the code will not be executed.

  * To calculate the probability of rolling a 6, you would simply pass the number 6 to the probability_of_rolling_number() function. For example, if you run the code above, the output would be:
