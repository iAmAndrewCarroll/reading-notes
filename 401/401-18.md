## Cryptography Concepts

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions to generate the ciphertext. It was historically used by Julius Caesar for secure communication with his generals during military campaigns.

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption is commonly used today to establish secure communication channels and protect sensitive information.

### Random Number Generation
Computers generate random numbers using random number generators (RNGs). True random number generation (TRNG) relies on physical processes like atmospheric noise or radioactive decay to produce truly unpredictable numbers. Pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) uses deterministic algorithms to generate sequences of numbers that appear random. TRNG is used in cryptography when strong randomness is required, while PRNG is suitable for non-cryptographic applications.

### Encryption and Decryption
Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a key. It ensures the confidentiality of information by making it unreadable. Decryption is the reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and the corresponding key. It allows authorized parties to access and understand the original message.

In summary, the Caesar Cipher is a letter substitution technique, asymmetric encryption uses public and private keys, random numbers are generated using TRNG or PRNG, and encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext while decryption reverses the process.
