# Reading Notes

1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.
Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are used to define specific behaviors for built-in operations or features of Python classes. They allow customization and enhancement of object behavior, making classes behave more like built-in types.

One commonly used dunder method is __repr__. It returns a string that ideally represents a valid Python expression capable of recreating an object.

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

p = Point(3, 4)
print(p)  # Output: Point(3, 4)

2. In the video "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course," what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers' work, and how might this have been avoided?

The main ethical issue raised in the video was that Siraj, the AI Guru, used other people's code without giving proper credit. He would incorporate code snippets from other developers into his own content without acknowledging their contributions.

This issue could have been avoided if Siraj had simply provided clear and explicit credit to the original developers whose code he utilized. By properly attributing the work and being transparent about his level of involvement, the ethical concerns surrounding the use of developers' work would have been addressed.

3. The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides functions for performing various statistical operations. It offers a range of functions to calculate basic statistical measures, such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more. The module is part of the Python Standard Library and does not require any external installations.

One example of a function within the module is statistics.mean(). This function can be used to calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

For example, the following code would calculate the mean of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

mean_value = statistics.mean(data)

print("Mean:", mean_value)

Output: Mean: 3.0
