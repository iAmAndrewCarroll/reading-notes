# React 1 Reading Questions

## Question 1

Three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript are:

* `const` and `let` keywords: These keywords allow you to declare variables that are block-scoped, meaning that they can only be accessed within the block in which they are declared. This is in contrast to the `var` keyword, which declares variables that are function-scoped.
* `Arrow functions`: Arrow functions are a new type of function that are more concise and efficient than traditional functions. They are also more flexible, as they can be used as expressions or statements.
* `Template literals`: Template literals are a new way of creating strings that allow you to embed expressions within the string. This can be useful for creating dynamic strings or for formatting strings in a consistent way.

## Question 2

Utility classes in Tailwind CSS are a way to quickly and easily style HTML elements. They are a set of pre-defined classes that you can use to add different styles to your elements. For example, you could use the `text-center` class to center text within an element, or the `bg-blue-500` class to set the background color of an element to blue.

Here is an example of how to use utility classes to style an HTML element:

<!-- html -->
```<div class="text-center bg-blue-500">```
  ```This is a centered blue box.```
```</div>```


## Question 3

The main advantages of using Next.js for web development are:

* **Server-side rendering:** Next.js renders your pages on the server before sending them to the client. This means that your pages will be fully rendered by the time they reach the user, which can improve performance and SEO.
* **Static site generation:** Next.js can be used to generate static pages, which can be served up by a CDN for even better performance.
* **Routing:** Next.js has a built-in routing system that makes it easy to create and manage complex applications.
* **API routes:** Next.js allows you to create API routes that can be used to expose data to other applications.

Traditional client-side rendering is when a web page is rendered on the client's browser after the page has been loaded. This can be slow, especially for pages with a lot of content. Server-side rendering, on the other hand, renders the page on the server before it is sent to the client. This can improve performance because the page is already rendered when it reaches the client.

Here is a table that compares traditional client-side rendering and Next.js's server-side rendering approach:

| Feature | Traditional client-side rendering | Next.js server-side rendering |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Can be slow for pages with a lot of content | Faster because the page is already rendered when it reaches the client |
| SEO | Can be difficult to optimize for SEO | Easier to optimize for SEO because the page is rendered on the server |
| Static site generation | Not possible | Possible with Next.js |
| API routes | Not possible | Possible with Next.js |
