## Implementation: Graphs - Journey through the Social Network

### WHY are graphs useful?
Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and they have a wide range of applications, including social networks, route planning, recommendation systems, and more. Understanding graphs will give you powerful tools to solve complex problems efficiently.

### WHAT are graphs made of?

- Nodes (Vertices): In our social network, nodes represent individuals - they could be you, me, or anyone in the boot camp. Each person is uniquely identified by their name or ID.

- Edges (Connections): The edges between nodes represent friendships. If person A is friends with person B, we create an edge between them. Edges may have weights, indicating the strength or closeness of the friendship.

### HOW do we represent graphs?
There are several ways to represent graphs in Python, but let's focus on two common methods:

1. **Adjacency Matrix**: This method uses a 2D matrix to represent the connections between nodes. If person A and person B are friends, then `adj_matrix[A][B]` would be 1 (or the weight if it's a weighted graph).

2. **Adjacency List**: This method uses a dictionary, where each node maps to a list of its neighbors. It's more memory-efficient for sparse graphs.

Let's illustrate this with a small example:

# Using an adjacency list to represent the graph

graph = {
    'Alice': ['Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Bob': ['Alice', 'David'],
    'Charlie': ['Alice', 'David'],
    'David': ['Bob', 'Charlie']
}

Now that weve built our social network graph, we can perform various operations on it, such as finding friends of friends, checking if two people are connected, or finding the shortest path between two individuals.

## Answers

1. The nodes in a graph represent **individuals**.
2. The edges in a graph represent **friendships**.
3. The representation of graphs that is more memory-efficient for sparse graphs is **Adjacency List**.
4. If person A and person B are friends, and the graph is unweighted, the value in the adjacency matrix at `adj_matrix[A][B]` will be **1** (indicating a direct connection).
