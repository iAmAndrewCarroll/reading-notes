**1. What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?**

- Scraping static websites:
  - Fixed HTML content.
  - Data readily available in the HTML source code.

- Scraping dynamic websites:
  - Content changes dynamically, often through JavaScript.
  - Data may be loaded asynchronously or generated dynamically.

**2. Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.**

- Implementing delays:
  - Adding pauses between requests to mimic human behavior.

- Using proxies:
  - Rotating IP addresses through proxy servers to distribute requests.

- Employing user-agent headers:
  - Setting the user-agent header to match a legitimate browser.

**3. What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.**

- Playwright is a Python library for automating browser interactions.
- Benefits of Playwright in web scraping:
  - Interacting with JavaScript-driven elements.
  - Handling complex scenarios like login and dynamic content.
  - Capturing network traffic and taking screenshots.
  - Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Example use case: Scraping a website that requires login. Playwright can automate the login process and access protected content for scraping.

**4. Describe the purpose of using XPath in web scraping, and provide an example of an XPath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.**

- Purpose of using XPath in web scraping:
  - XPath is used to navigate and select elements in XML or HTML documents.
  - It helps target specific elements based on their structure, attributes, or text content.

- Example XPath expression:
  - `//div[@class="product-title"]/a`
    - This expression selects the `<a>` element within a `<div>` with the attribute `class` equal to "product-title".
    - It can be used to extract specific product titles from a webpage.
