# Reading Day 3

1. What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?
   * The with statement in Python ensures that resources are closed automatically, even if an exception occurs. This is important for files, as they can consume system resources.
   * `with open("myfile.txt") as f:`
        `contents = f.read()`

2. Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.
   * The read() method reads the entire contents of a file into a string, while the readline() method reads a single line from a file.
     * The read() method is useful when you need to read the entire contents of a file into a variable. For example, you might use the read() method to read a configuration file or a log file.
   * The readline() method is useful when you need to read the contents of a file line by line. For example, you might use the readline() method to read a text file or a CSV file.

3. Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.
   * Exception handling in Python is a way to handle unexpected errors that may occur during the execution of a program. The try block is used to define the code that may raise an exception, the except block is used to handle the exception, and the finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether or not an exception occurs.
