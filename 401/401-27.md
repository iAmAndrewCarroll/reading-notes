# Django Models

1. The purpose of Django models is to define the structure and behavior of data in a Django application. They represent database tables and provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the database. Models help in creating and managing the database schema by defining fields, relationships, and behaviors such as validations, constraints, and queries.

2. The Django Admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a user-friendly interface for managing data in the application's database. It offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality out of the box. It can be customized by defining ModelAdmin classes to specify the display, filters, search capabilities, and actions for specific models. The admin interface can also be styled and customized using templates, CSS, and JavaScript to meet the specific needs of the project.

3. The key components of a Django application are models, views, templates, and URLs. Models define the data structure and logic, views handle requests and produce responses, templates generate the HTML output, and URLs map the URL patterns to appropriate views. The workflow typically involves a user making a request, which is routed to a view based on the URL configuration. The view interacts with models to fetch or modify data and renders a template to produce the response, which is then sent back to the user's browser.
   * Models: define the data that your application will store in teh database
   * Views: responsible for handling requests and returning a response
   * Templates: used to render the HTML pages that are displayed to the user
   * URLs: map requests from the user to views
   * Middleware: used to intercept requests and responses and perform custom processing.
