1. **What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?**

   The key principles for organizing and configuring Django settings in a project are:

   - Keep sensitive information, such as secret keys and database passwords, in environment variables.
   - Use separate settings modules for different environments (e.g., development, production).
   - Avoid hardcoding settings and use configuration files instead.
   - Utilize Python's `configparser` or similar libraries to manage settings.
   - Use meaningful names for settings variables and modules for clarity.

2. **How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?**

   The White Noise library enhances the serving of static files in a Django application by efficiently handling the serving of these files directly, without involving the web server in development and some production environments. It improves performance and reduces unnecessary web server configurations.

   Steps to integrate White Noise into a Django project:

   1. Install White Noise: `pip install whitenoise`
   2. Add `'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware'` to the `MIDDLEWARE` setting in Django settings.
   3. Ensure `STATIC_URL` is set correctly in settings.
   4. Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory.
   5. Configure the web server (e.g., Gunicorn) to serve the static files from `STATIC_ROOT`.

3. **What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications, and how can it be implemented and configured in a Django project to control access to resources?**

   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (e.g., APIs) from different domains. It prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests, ensuring that only specific domains are allowed to access the resources.

   CORS can be implemented and configured in a Django project using the `django-cors-headers` library.

   Steps to configure CORS in a Django project:

   1. Install `django-cors-headers`: `pip install django-cors-headers`
   2. Add `'corsheaders'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in Django settings.
   3. Configure CORS settings, specifying allowed origins, methods, headers, and other options, in the Django settings.
