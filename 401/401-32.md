### Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions

DRF Permissions are key components in Django Rest Framework that provide a way to control access to APIs. They help secure an API by defining who can perform certain actions based on user roles and permissions.

There are several types of DRF Permissions:

1. **IsAuthenticated**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access the API.
2. **IsAdminUser**: Allows access only to admin users.
3. **IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly**: Allows read access to any user but requires authentication for write operations.
4. **AllowAny**: Permits access to anyone, whether authenticated or not.

By utilizing these permissions, you can control which users can view, create, update, or delete resources within your API, making it more secure and tailored to your specific use case.

### SQL SELECT Statement

In SQL, the `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and apply filters to narrow down the results.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', the query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees; * wildcard for all columns in employees table. returns all rows/columns of data stored in the table


### Role of DRF Generic Views

DRF Generic Views are pre-built views provided by Django Rest Framework to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs. They abstract common patterns and logic, reducing the amount of code you need to write for typical operations.

These views serve as reusable components that handle common actions such as retrieving a list of objects, creating new objects, updating existing objects, and retrieving a single object by its ID. By using DRF Generic Views, you can implement standard CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations with minimal effort.

Instead of writing custom views and handling repetitive tasks for different API endpoints, you can leverage DRF Generic Views to streamline the development process, improve code maintainability, and ensure consistency in your API design.

DRF Generic Views are highly flexible and can be easily extended and customized to suit your specific requirements. They are an essential part of building RESTful APIs efficiently and effectively using Django Rest Framework.
