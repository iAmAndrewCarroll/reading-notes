# Authentication and Production Servers

## What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to securely transmit data between parties. They are encoded as a JSON object, and they are signed using a secret key. This makes them tamper-proof and prevents unauthorized access to the data.

## How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?

JWT Authentication can be used to secure API endpoints in Django REST Framework. The key components involved in this process are the `JWTSerializer` and the `JWTAuthentication` class. The `JWTSerializer` is used to serialize and deserialize JWT tokens, and the `JWTAuthentication` class is used to authenticate requests that contain JWT tokens.

## Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?

Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments because it is not designed to handle high traffic. It also does not provide any security features, such as HTTPS. Some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application include Gunicorn, uWSGI, and Nginx.

## In your own words, why is it important to learn about authentication and production servers?

Authentication and production servers are two important aspects of Django development. Authentication is important for securing your application, and production servers are important for deploying your application to the real world. By learning about these topics, you can make sure that your Django applications are secure and reliable.

## As a bonus, can you share a funny story about your experience learning about authentication or production servers?

Not really.  I haven't had anything funny happen while trying to learn about authentication or production servers.  It has legit been incredibly difficult for me while also being a bad time.
