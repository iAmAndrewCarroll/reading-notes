# Readings: Django CRUD and Forms

**1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?**

Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing an abstraction to define HTML forms using Python code. Key components of creating a form in Django include:

- Defining a form class (derived from `forms.Form` or `forms.ModelForm`).
- Specifying form fields and their validation rules using Django's built-in form fields (e.g., `CharField`, `IntegerField`, etc.).
- Rendering the form in templates using Django's template language (e.g., `{{ form.as_p }}`) and including `{% csrf_token %}` for security.

**2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.**

Django Templates serve as the presentation layer in web development. They allow the dynamic rendering of HTML pages with data from Django's views. Template inheritance enhances code reusability and maintainability by allowing developers to:

- Define a base template containing common elements (e.g., header, footer) and placeholders for content (e.g., `{% block content %}`).
- Create child templates that extend the base template using `{% extends 'base.html' %}` and filling in the placeholders with specific content using `{% block content %}`.

**3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.**

Django Views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. They contain the business logic for processing user requests and preparing data for rendering templates. 

- **Function-based views**: Defined as Python functions. Straightforward and suitable for simple views.
- **Class-based views**: Offer more modularity and functionality through inheritance and mixins, making complex views more manageable. They allow defining view logic as class methods (e.g., `get()`, `post()`) and provide reusable behavior through mixins.
