## How The Web Works

### What happens when you view a webpage on your computer or phone?

  * Computers connected to the internet are called **clients** and **servers**
  * ![client.server image](./img/clientserver.png "client & server image")
  * Clients are typical web user's internet-connected devices
  * Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.

### Other Parts of the Toolbox

* Internet Connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web.  
* TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.  The transport mechanism.
* DNS: Domain Name System is like an address pook for websites.  Type in a web address and your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website.
* HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
* Component Files: Website is made up of many files.
  * Code Files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  * Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website such as images, music, video, Word Documents, and PDFs

### So What Happens, Exactly?

1. Browser goes to DNS server, finds real address of the server the website lives on.
2. Browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. All messages are sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
3. If the server approves the clients request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is!" and sends the files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.
4. Browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you.

### Order in Which Component Files Are Parsed

* Browser sends requests to servers for HTML files which often contain `<link>` elements referencing external **CSS** stylesheets and `<script>` elements referencing external **JavaScript** scripts.  The order in which these are parsed by the browser is important to know
  * Browser parses the HTML file first, that leads to the browser recognizing any `<link>`-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any `<script>`-element references to scripts
  * As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from `<link>` elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from `<script>` elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript
  * Browser generates an in-memory `Document Object Model (DOM)` tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory `CSS Object Model (CSSOM)` structure fro mthe parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript
  * As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it

### Domain Name System DNS Explained

* Real web addresses are special numbers that look like this: `63.245.215.20`
* This is called an **IP Address** and it represents a unique location on the web...but it is difficult to remember
* DNS uses special servers that match up a web address you type into your browser to the website's real IP address.

### Packets Explained

* Data is sent across the internet in small chunks called packets
* Sometimes packets can be dropped or corrupted and it is easier to replace small chunks when this happens
* Packets can be routed along different paths making the exchange faster and allow many different usersto download the same website at the same time
* If websites were sent as a single bug chunk only one user could download it at a time

# What Will Your Website Look Like?

## First Things First: Planning

1. What is your website about?
2. What information are you presenting on the subject?
3. What does your website look like in simple high-level terms?  
   * What's the background color? 
   * What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

### Sketching out your design

* Wireframe out your site design
* Just sketch it on some paper or use a site like [InVision Collaborative Whiteboard](https://www.invisionapp.com/)

### Choose Your Assets

* Text: What is your content?  Paragraphs and titles, etc

* Theme Color:  You can use [a color picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) or you can leverage a brand kit
  * <span style="color:#4c586f">This</span>
  * <span style="color:#62abbd">Example</span>
  * <span style="color:#142632">Rocks</span>

* Images: You can use whatever image you'd like!
* ![iAmAndrewCarroll Reading Poetry](./img/IMG_6574.jpg)

* Font: You can use [Getting Started With Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) to find the code that can be copy pasta'd into your HTML or readme.md
