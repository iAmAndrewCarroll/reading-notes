## Practice with git
<img src="./gidiot.jpeg" alt="(reference)[http://acronymsandslang.com/definition/6938862/GIT-meaning.html]">

### Cloning The Repository
- `git clone [link to repository]`

### ACP (Add, Commit, Push)

- `git status` shows what files have changed
- `git add .` stages new and modified files only
- `git commit -m ""them changes" by Thundercat"` commits the changes and creates a record of what was changed enclosed in the quotes
- `git push origin main` this pushes the changes from the local "main" branch to the remote repository named "origin"

<sub>git automatically gives the name "origin" to the server or cloud location and "master" to the local branch</sub>

### What is Version Control?
- A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- Can be local, centralized, or distributed

### What is `cloning` in git?
- This clones the source repository
or
- Creates a copy of an existing git repository from a particular server
- Copies all versions of all files for a project
- Copies newest version of the project

### What is the command to track and stage files?
- `git add .` or `git add filename`

### What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
- `git commit -a` or `git commit -m "them changes"`

### What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
- `git push origin main`

## Stretch Goal - Clean Commitment (I have attachement issues)
