# Growth Mindset (In My Own Words)

## A ***Growth Mindset*** means remaining open to unfamiliar, value creating ideas, solutions, and strategies.

### 3 Reminders to Keep it Growing:
1. Be open to feedback from your leadership and stakeholders
2. Take a step back, reevaluate the big picture, and see where you can adjust 
3. Reframe and start with the end in mind.  
   - Am I approaching this problem in a way that achieves the desired result?
   - How does my piece of this puzzle fit with the rest?

# About the Creative
Andrew Thomas Carroll spent the first 35 years of his life as
a self-hating black man. Now, after years of Psychedelic
Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy and Shadow Hunting,
he returns to the world with a purpose and a voice. Andrew
was given a gift for word magic and discernment. His depth
of vision allows him to identify the underlying incentives driving
micro and macro decisions that impact individuals in personal
relationship and the greater population through media programming and economic policy. 
Additionally, Andrew strives to breathe new life into
the Eternal Ember that is always inside of you. By sharing
his personal journey he hopes to vulnerably demonstrate the
poetic art of personal evolution.

Andrew is a gifted speaker and loves spoken word,
improvising vocals with a jam band, getting outside in the
dirt, camping, hiking, water and moving his body through
dance and weight lifting. Nutrition is a key part of mental
health and Andrew has an intimate understanding of what it
takes to stay lean and healthy after a lifetime of self abuse.
Axé & Amen.
