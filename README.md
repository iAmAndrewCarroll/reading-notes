# Growth Mindset (In My Own Words)

## A ***Growth Mindset*** means remaining open to unfamiliar, value creating ideas, solutions, and strategies.

### 3 Reminders to Keep it Growing:
1. Be open to feedback from your leadership and stakeholders
2. Take a step back, reevaluate the big picture, and see where you can adjust 
3. Reframe and start with the end in mind.  
   - Am I approaching this problem in a way that achieves the desired result?
   - How does my piece of this puzzle fit with the rest?
